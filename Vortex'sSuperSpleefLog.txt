Log of STUFF! :)


Stuff to do:
1. Menu for playable characters.
2. Sync world upon joining as a spectator, that players that spectate aren't desynced.
	1. If the system is fast, maybe convert worldgen to this system for non-spectators, that way we could allow for modded maps and pre-built maps.
3. Better UI for the list of players in Multiplayer game lobby.
4. Sync Player IDs (Make sure every player has a synced index across clients). This may require special networking logic, or other means of sorting.
	1. Right now, items gained from the drill aren't synced visually (held in player hand). If Player IDs can be synced, that issue can also be fixed
5. Ability to open up and manage the inventory (right now, the inventory is inaccessible except for the hotbar).
6. Prevent incompatible versions from connecting to each other
7. Melee Weapon
8. Unify Item display systems (inventory and held item should use the same system)


8/31/24
1. Added a Drill Item that mines faster (20 -> 10), and also has a 66.67% chance to harvest blocks
	1. Temporarily, this drill is a HAMMER
2. Added a model system for non-block items!

8/29/24 to 8/31/24
1. Worldgen settings UI

8. Chaos Worlds also shuffle chunks strangely

8/26/24 to 8/27/24
1. Changed base world size 15 -> 6
2. Shift now slows down the player, instead of causing a sprint. Base move speed/max speed increased 2.0 -> 2.4, 5 -> 5.5
3. New UI Sprites!
4. Shift also causes the player to "Safe Walk", allowing them to place blocks without falling off platforms
5. "Safe Walk" has a crouch animation
6. "Safe Walk" syncs in MP
7. Fix some text sizes, some new randomizeable words for generating Usernames and splash text
8. WIP Worldgen settings UI
