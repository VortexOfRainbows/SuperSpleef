Log of STUFF! :)


Stuff to do:
1. Special menu for Worldgen settings, instead of just being inside the normal settings menu.
2. Menu for playable characters.
3. Sync world upon joining as a spectator, that players that spectate aren't desynced.
	1. If the system is fast, maybe convert worldgen to this system for non-spectators, that way we could allow for modded maps and pre-built maps.
4. Better UI for the list of players in Multiplayer game lobby.
5. Sync Player IDs (Make sure every player has a synced index across clients). This may require special networking logic, or other means of sorting.
6. Ability to open up and manage the inventory (right now, the inventory is inaccessible except for the hotbar).


8/26/24 to 8/27/24
1. Changed base world size 15 -> 6
2. Shift now slows down the player, instead of causing a sprint. Base move speed/max speed increased 2.0 -> 2.4, 5 -> 5.5
3. New UI Sprites!
4. Shift also causes the player to "Safe Walk", allowing them to place blocks without falling off platforms
5. "Safe Walk" has a crouch animation
6. "Safe Walk" syncs in MP
7. Fix some text sizes, some new randomizeable words for generating Usernames and splash text
8. WIP Worldgen settings UI

8/25/24
